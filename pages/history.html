                    Over a dozen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_medical_papyri" target="_blank">medical papyri</a> have been preserved, 
                    most notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Smith_Papyrus" target="_blank">Edwin Smith Papyrus</a> 
                    (the oldest extant surgical handbook) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebers_Papyrus" target="_blank">Ebers Papyrus</a>
                    (a handbook of preparing and using materia medica for various diseases).
                    Ancient Egypt is also known for developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embalming" target="_blank">embalming</a>, which was used for
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummy" target="_blank">mummification</a>, in order to preserve human remains and forestall decomposition.

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology" target="_blank">Animal physiology</a> was studied for divination, 
                    including especially the anatomy of the liver, seen as an important organ in haruspicy. 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology" target="_blank">Animal behavior</a> too was studied for divinatory 
                    purposes. Most information about the training and domestication of animals was probably transmitted 
                    orally, but one text dealing with the training of horses has survived.

                    In ancient China, earlier conceptions can be found dispersed across several different disciplines, 
                    including the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_herbology" target="_blank">herbologists</a>, physicians, 
                    alchemists, and philosophers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism" target="_blank">The Taoist</a> tradition 
                    of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_alchemy" target="_blank"></a>Chinese alchemy, for example, emphasized health 
                    (with the ultimate goal being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_of_life" target="_blank">elixir of life</a>). 
                    Taoist philosophers also expressed ideas related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution" target="_blank">evolution</a>, 
                    such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in 
                    response to differing environments.

                    One of the oldest organised systems of medicine is known from ancient India in the form of 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda" target="_blank">Ayurveda</a>, which originated from 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atharvaveda" target="_blank">Atharvaveda</a> (one of the four most ancient books 
                    of Indian knowledge, wisdom and culture).One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the

                    an antient text about medicine. It was also an early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materia_medica" target="_blank">materia medica</a>, 
                    describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.
